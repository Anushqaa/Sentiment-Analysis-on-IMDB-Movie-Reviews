Sentiment analysis is a fascinating field within natural language processing, and this project dives deep into understanding the sentiments behind IMDB movie reviews. Leveraging a combination of data preprocessing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques, this showcase project demonstrates how to build and evaluate sentiment analysis models.

## Introduction

In this project, we aim to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of 50,000 IMDB movie reviews. The goal is to classify these reviews into two categories: positive and negative sentiment. This analysis can provide valuable insights into the public perception of movies and help businesses and filmmakers gauge audience reactions.

## Project Highlights

### Data Preprocessing

- The project begins by downloading the IMDB dataset and preparing it for analysis.
- Text data undergoes various preprocessing steps, including HTML tag removal, special character removal, and lemmatization.
- The NLTK library is used for natural language processing tasks, such as stopword removal and lemmatization.

### Data Visualization

- Data visualization is employed to gain insights into the dataset.
- Word clouds are generated to visualize the most common words in both positive and negative reviews.
- The distribution of review lengths is visualized to better understand the dataset.

### Machine Learning Models

- Several machine learning models are implemented to classify sentiments based on bag-of-words (BoW) and TF-IDF features.
- Models include Logistic Regression, K Neighbors Classification, and Multinomial Naive Bayes.
- Cross-validation is used to evaluate model performance, and the best-performing model is selected for further analysis.

### Deep Learning Models

- Deep learning models are explored to improve sentiment classification.
- Multiple architectures are experimented with, including models with convolutional layers and recurrent layers.
- Model 6, a combination of convolutional and bidirectional LSTM layers, yields the best results and is chosen for further training.

### GloVe Embeddings

- GloVe word embeddings are incorporated into the best-performing deep learning model to enhance its performance.
- These pre-trained embeddings help capture the semantic meaning of words.
- The model's weights are initialized with the embeddings and fine-tuned during training.

## Results

- The chosen deep learning model with GloVe embeddings achieves high accuracy in sentiment classification.
- The project showcases the power of deep learning in handling complex natural language understanding tasks.
- The model demonstrates its ability to generalize to the test set effectively.

## Conclusion

Sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in understanding and interpreting textual data. This project showcases the process of sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews, starting from data preprocessing to implementing machine learning and deep learning models. The integration of pre-trained word embeddings further enhances the model's performance. The insights gained from this project can be applied to various applications, such as market research, customer feedback analysis, and recommendation systems in the entertainment industry.

# Deep Learning for Sentiment Analysis

Sentiment analysis is a fascinating field in natural language processing that involves classifying text as positive, negative, or neutral. In this GitHub repository, we explore sentiment analysis using deep learning techniques. We'll take you through the entire process, from data preprocessing to building and training deep learning models, all with the goal of classifying movie reviews as positive or negative.

## Deep Learning Techniques

We use various deep learning techniques to perform sentiment analysis:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: We clean and preprocess the text data, including tasks such as HTML tag removal, lowercasing, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

2. **Data Visualization**: We visualize the data using word clouds and histograms to gain insights into the dataset.

3. **Machine Learning Baseline**: We establish a baseline using traditional machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Multinomial Naive Bayes.

4. **Deep Learning Models**: We build several deep learning models, including Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory Networks (LSTMs), and combinations of both, to classify reviews.

5. **Word Embeddings**: We explore the use of pre-trained GloVe word embeddings to enhance the performance of our models.

6. **TensorBoard Integration**: We utilize TensorBoard to visualize training and validation metrics for our deep learning models.

## Choose Your Model

We provide multiple deep learning models for sentiment analysis, each with its own strengths. Feel free to experiment and choose the one that suits your needs. Our favorite is Model 6, which combines Convolutional Neural Networks and Bidirectional LSTMs.
